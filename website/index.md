    subtitle: Nix & Lua
    text:
      - I've been running on NixOS for a while now and have compiled a repository containing my custom configuration for it.
      - My goal was to design a system which maximizes the usage of screen space.
        Thus, this system has no bars.
        Instead system interactions like changing wifi networks, switching windows or launching applications are done using centerpiece, an extendable launcher.
